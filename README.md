# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
echo "# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn in a telecom dataset using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave the company so proactive retention strategies can be planned.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction-ml.git
\`\`\`
2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML.ipynb
\`\`\`

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **~80%**.
